# Django-Website
A sample website using Django framework. Django is a back-end server side web framework.Django is free, open source and written in Python. Django makes it easier to build web pages using Python. Django's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites. The framework emphasizes reusability and "pluggability" of components, less code, low coupling, rapid development, and the principle of don't repeat yourself. Python is used throughout, even for settings, files, and data models. Django also provides an optional administrative create, read, update and delete interface that is generated dynamically through introspection and configured via admin models.

Some well-known sites that use Django include Instagram, Mozilla, Disqus, Bitbucket, Nextdoor and Clubhouse.

Django was created in the fall of 2003, when the web programmers at the Lawrence Journal-World newspaper, Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison, began using Python to build applications. Jacob Kaplan-Moss was hired early in Django's development shortly before Simon Willison's internship ended.  It was released publicly under a BSD license in July 2005. The framework was named after guitarist Django Reinhardt. In June 2008, it was announced that a newly formed Django Software Foundation (DSF) would maintain Django in the future.
